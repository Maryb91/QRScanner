SharpQRScanner is my first iOS app that i have developed after completing a Swift course on Udemy.

The main features of SharpQRScanner are:

âœ… Scan a QR code using the iPhone's camera

âœ… Scan a QR code using an image from Photo Library

âœ… A history of previously scanned QR codes

âœ… Perfom actions on scanned QR codes depending on its type : 

    - Copy a text
    - Search a text on google
    - Add a contact to the contacts list
    - Load a website in the browser
    - Open an email in the default email app
    - Call a phone number
    - Share
    
âœ… A settings page
